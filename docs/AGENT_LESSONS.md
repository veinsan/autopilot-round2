# Agent Lessons

Persistent lessons for future Codex/Claude sessions. Add a short entry whenever
an implementation or verification attempt fails; record the prevention, not
credentials or confidential payloads.

- Split unrelated `apply_patch` changes. A missing line (especially with mixed
  encodings) otherwise rejects the entire patch; inspect the exact target first.
- After a file has changed repeatedly, re-read the current block before a
  multi-file patch. A stale reconciliation context rejected an otherwise valid
  cancellation patch; applying the files separately avoided hidden omissions.
- Run Python tests in the backend image when host dependencies are absent.
  Do not assume host `pytest` is installed, and do not retry it after this
  condition has already been recorded; use `compileall` separately, then Docker.
- In additive SQL scripts, create a table before any `alter table` targeting it.
  Re-read migration order after moving blocks, including clean-install behavior.
- Validate frontend changes with `docker compose build frontend`; the production
  container does not include source files for an in-container rebuild.
- Normalize the POSIX entrypoint inside the Docker image because Windows CRLF
  checkouts can make `/bin/sh` fail before the application starts.
- Do not infer Auto credential validity from one ambiguous HTTP response. Use
  read-only control requests and report an upstream ambiguity when valid and
  deliberately-invalid credentials produce the same response.
- Check `rg --files` output before reading an assumed root dependency file;
  this repository keeps Python requirements under `packages/`.
- If Docker is inactive and a temporary dependency download is network-blocked,
  record verification as blocked after one bounded attempt. Do not leave an
  escalated package-install process waiting indefinitely; terminate and use
  offline compile/smoke checks.
- Do not assume tools listed in `packages/requirements.txt` are installed on the
  Windows host (`pytest`, `flake8`, and transitive imports such as SQLAlchemy may
  be absent). Use the complete backend image for authoritative tests; keep host
  checks limited to modules whose import graph is available.
- Do not guess seed/config filenames after a search result. Read only the paths
  returned by `rg --files` (the policy seed is a script, not a SQL seed file).
- Apply the same rule to runtime configuration: enumerate `gunicorn/` before
  opening a presumed shared config; this repository has only `dev.py` and
  `prod.py`.
- A Docker test image must include every repository-relative fixture directory
  used by tests (`config/` and `dataset/csv/` here). Compose should mount test
  inputs read-only so local changes do not require an image rebuild.
- Current HTTPX uses `ASGITransport(app=...)`; do not pass `app=` directly to
  `AsyncClient`, because that compatibility argument has been removed.
- Authentication tests must set the module-level `AUTH_BYPASS` explicitly;
  Compose enables bypass for development, so inheriting its environment turns
  an unauthorized-request assertion into a misleading 200 response.
- Leave cleanup headroom above the pytest runtime when wrapping `docker compose
  run` in a command timeout; a suite finishing near the limit can otherwise be
  reported as exit 124 during container removal.
- Check whether `pdftotext` exists before relying on it. If it is unavailable,
  use a temporary PDF library outside the repository and keep the repo clean.
- Force UTF-8 stdout before printing extracted PDF text on Windows; the default
  code page can fail on punctuation such as non-breaking hyphens.
